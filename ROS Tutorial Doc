Titles 

Ros2 workspace :
	Install a build tool colcon for Ros2 workspace. 
	
		sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions
	
	Adding codes in the bash file for auto complete in the bashrc
	
		source /usr/share/colcon_argcomplete/hook/colcon-argcomplete.bash

Ros2 workspace is a folder

make a src folder inside

colcon build #to build it as ros package

Create a package 
ros2 pkg create "package_name" --buid-type ament_"cmake/python" --dependencies rclpy
	we have to choose which type we need we can choose between python and c++
	each package is a subpart of an application and can have many nodes and dependencies
	ament is the build system inside colcon build tool
	rclpy is the python library for ros2

Always build the package from the ros workspace (ros2_ws)

Contents of package 
	Package.xml
		
		we can also add dependencies
	setup.cfg
	setup.py 
	
	test
	
	resource
	
ros2 topic list   #Lists all the topic

ros2 topic info "TopicName" #Give info of type of data and subscribers and publishers to the topic

ros2 topic echo "Topicname" #Creates a subscribers and prints the messages

ros2 interface show "msg_name" #gives inofrmation about the messages

chmod +x "filename" to make it in to a executable

#!/usr/bin/env python3 should be added as the first line  

for subsribing data
	self.pose_subscriber = self.create_subscription(
            "messagetype", "messagename", "callbackfunction", "buffersize")
